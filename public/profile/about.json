    "about": "A wise man once told me that there’s no such thing as an objectively good or bad person—only those who strive to be well-rounded balls of mayhem. I’ve embraced that philosophy, living a life guided by gratitude, hard work, and humility. I celebrate my triumphs, learn from my failures, and approach every challenge with an open mind and relentless curiosity.\n\n In my previous career as a chef, I led diverse teams, tackled high-pressure situations, and mastered the art of interpersonal and professional problem-solving—all while fostering collaboration and cohesion. When it was time to transition from the kitchen, I sought a career that would still challenge me creatively, allow me to solve problems, and offer greater personal freedom. \n\n Technology had always intrigued me, both as a tool in the kitchen and in my personal life, and it ultimately led me to pursue an education and career as a software engineer. Today, I’m driven by the desire to craft efficient, user-centered solutions for real-world clients. With my collaborative mindset, growth-oriented attitude, and knack for problem-solving, I’m excited to make meaningful contributions in the tech world.  ",
